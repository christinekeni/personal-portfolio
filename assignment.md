All issues were addressed using feature branches with consistent naming 

### ðŸ’¬ Commit Messages

Structured using the format:
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

**Examples**:
- `feat: add responsive navigation bar`
- `fix: adjust card alignment on small screens`

---

## âœ… Pull Requests & Merge Conflicts

- PRs were created for all feature branches.  
- Each PR was linked to its corresponding issue and milestone.  
- Reviews were simulated by requesting feedback from peers.  
- A **merge conflict** was intentionally simulated:

  - **Conflict Location**: `index.html` (hero heading)  
  - **Resolved by**: Editing the conflicting line and committing the fix  
  - **Commit Message**: `fix(conflict): resolved hero heading merge conflict`

## âœ… Deployment
